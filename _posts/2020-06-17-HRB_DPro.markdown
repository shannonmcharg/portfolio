### Problem
* Users who donated more than one type of item to a charity had to enter each item individually on a separate line.
* Users didnâ€™t understand what the Details button was for or how to access the details required for donations over $500.

### Process

### Solution
* Added the ability to enter a series of items for each trip to a charity.
* Clarified the detail entry process.

### Results
