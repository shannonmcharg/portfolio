Enable tax professionals to explain to clients how they arrived at their refund or balance due.

### Process

### Solution
* Designed a graph view that shows where the clientâ€™s money goes in a tax return.
* Collaborated with a visual designer to ensure the visual design conveyed the message.
* Tested with clients and tax pros to ensure the graph facilitated the conversation.

### Tax Summary

### Results
* Designs performed well in usability studies.
* Launched as a beta the first year and then released nationwide the following year because it performed well in the field with both tax professionals and clients.
* Additional screens to visually explain tax data were designed the second year as a result of the success of this screen.
