### Problem
* A new client wasn’t satisfied with the organization of the ship information pages on Cruises Only’s site, so they requested a redesign before they would use the service.
* The information architecture wasn’t intuitive.
* Users weren’t able to easily drill down into detailed information they were looking for.
* Users couldn’t easily scan pages to find information they were looking for.
### Process

### Solution
* Revised the information architecture to match common user tasks.
* Changed the layout of pages to enable easy scanning and drilling.
* Templatized the pages for use with all of their clients.
