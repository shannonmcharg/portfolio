### Problem
* Revamp the existing phone app to add new functionality for uploading documents, viewing prior years returns, and logging into an account.
* Ensure consistency across platforms for the new functionality - i.e. if a user logs into an account to upload a document from the mobile app, the experience should be consistent with how it works online.
* Fix usability issues with the existing app.

### Process
