### Problem
* We had a difficult time identifying user issues that should be fixed in the product.
* Multiple reports had to be reconciled to determine what the issues were and the severity of the issues.
* We couldn't get a holistic view of the issues.

### Issue Identification Process

### Solution
Combine 5 reports into one.

#### Combining reports allowed us to
* Understand the total number of users who experience an issue.
* Take action on the issues in the report.
* Clearly see the effect that posting a given write-up has on volume.
* Identify trends in volume.
* Identify high-volume issues that need to be fixed.

#### How I got to one report
* Conducted a card sort with support agents to get accurate categorizations.
* Tied knowledgebase articles to the categories agents use.
* Developed a plan for ongoing maintenance of categories as new issues arise.

### Results
* Increased accuracy of support data.
* Better understanding of exactly what issues users experience.
* Improvements to the product.
* Also helps QA troubleshoot technical issues.
