### Problem
* The site was confusing and overwhelming for users.
* Users didn't know where to start or where to go for specific information.
* Subsites, such as the Application and Donation processes were confusing, as well, and buried within the main site.

### Process
![Image showing process including expert review, current sitemap analysis, card sort, revised sitemap, wireframes & page templates, and summative usability study.](./img/portfolio/CityYear/CY_Flow.jpg)
### Solution
* Revised information architecture to match card sort results.
* Standardized page layouts.
* Reworked subsites and processes to clarify purpose and process.
* Reorganized application process into logical groupings to make it clear what needs to be done and in what order it will be done.
* Made it clear that the user is in the application by taking away the site navigation.
