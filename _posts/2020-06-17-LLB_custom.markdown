### Problem
* The existing page to create a custom item used Flash and was unusable on tablets.
* The screen also didn't look like it was part of the rest of the site.

### Process

### Solution
* New screen using a third party configuration tool.
* Screen laid out to look like other product pages.
* Responsive to the viewport on tablets.
