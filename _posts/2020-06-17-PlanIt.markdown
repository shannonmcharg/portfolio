### Users
Architects and city planners use the PlanIt Impact to evaluate the environmental impact of their designs.
### Problem
Simplify a complex process to integrate open sustainability data with third-party structural design applications, making it easy for users to assess – and share – the environmental impacts of their designs.

### Process
With my teammates at Useagility, we interviewed several users to learn about what their needs were and did a few iterations on the design before it was built by their internal developers. I was the lead deisnger and responsible for conceptual and detailed design for each iteration.

### Solution
* Responsive web application that imports files from architectural software to evaluate sustainability of a design.
* Allows users to compare sustainability across multiple design options.

### Results
The final step prior to development was to incorporate the results of the concept testing into a fully-functioning prototype, including data integration and visualizations, then test it with users again. In this stage, we validated the responsive and adaptive features we designed for mobile devices and ensured the data visualizations were clear and intuitive.
