description: In 2016, I created a ballot website to help Mainers understand the referendum questions on statewide ballots. It had over 3,000 unique visitors leading up to the November 2018 election. In the last couple of years, Open Maine has gotten involved and volunteers have helped create and review the content on the site. During the 2018-2019 government shutdown, a colleague and I moved the site from Squarespace to GitHub to make it open source and available for people to fork and create similar sites for other states.
tasks: Product management, user research, interaction design, visual design, development
deliverables: Functioning website
